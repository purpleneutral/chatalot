# Our Mission

## Why Chatalot Exists

My entire life, I have put security and privacy at the forefront of everything I do online. In this day and age, those things are taken for granted. We hand over our conversations, our photos, our private moments to corporations who treat them as assets to be mined, sold, and surveilled. Most people don't think twice about it — until something goes wrong.

I do think twice. And I decided to do something about it.

Chatalot exists because the alternatives failed us. Every major chat platform on the market is corporate-owned. Your data sits on their servers, governed by their terms, subject to their business decisions. They can sell, get acquired, change policies overnight, or hand everything over to the highest bidder. You are not the customer — you are the product.

**I created Chatalot for me, myself, and I.** I needed a platform where my conversations are truly mine. Where no corporation can read my messages, monetize my data, or decide what I'm allowed to say in private. If you share that need, I invite you to use my software.

## This Is a Pet Project — And That's the Point

Like the creator of VLC, Chatalot is my passion project. It's not a startup chasing venture capital. It's not a product with quarterly revenue targets. There is no board of directors, no investors, no acqui-hire exit strategy. There's just me, building something I believe in.

That means:

- **No corporate overlord.** Nobody can buy Chatalot and gut it for parts. Nobody can pivot it into an ad platform. Nobody can shut it down because it's not profitable enough.
- **No ties to governments or shady organizations.** This project is independent. It serves its users, not a political agenda.
- **No paywalled features.** The full feature set is available to everyone. Optional subscriptions may come one day to keep the project sustainable, but free users will never be second-class citizens. You won't lose features, hit artificial limits, or see "upgrade to unlock" prompts. If you pay, it's because you want to support the project — not because you're forced to.
- **No telemetry, no analytics, no tracking.** I don't know who you are, I don't know what you say, and I don't care. That's the whole point.

## A Long-Term Commitment

I want to be clear about something: **Chatalot is here for the long haul.** This isn't a weekend hackathon project that gets abandoned in six months. I will continue to iterate, develop, and improve it for years to come.

There are many features planned. The roadmap is deep. Every release makes the platform more capable, more polished, and more worthy of your trust. I'm not just maintaining this — I'm actively building it, every day.

## Your Privacy Is Not My Business

I don't care what you do online. I don't care what you store, what you share, or who you talk to. It has never been my business, and it never will be.

That's not a slogan — it's architecture. Chatalot is built so that I *can't* read your messages even if I wanted to:

- **End-to-end encryption** on every message. The server stores ciphertext — random bytes that mean nothing without your keys.
- **Your keys never leave your device.** They're generated locally, stored locally, and used locally.
- **The server is an untrusted relay.** It routes messages but is architecturally separated from plaintext content.
- **Your password is never stored.** It's hashed with Argon2id — one of the strongest password hashing algorithms available. Nobody can recover it.
- **Zero telemetry.** No analytics scripts, no usage tracking, no crash reporting, no phone-home behavior.

I built Chatalot so that even the person running the server can't spy on you. That's the standard privacy should be held to.

## Privacy Is Not a Shield for Harm

Let me be direct: **Chatalot is a tool for privacy, not a tool for crime.** I built this software because I believe private conversations are a fundamental right. I do not build it to enable illegal activity, and I do not endorse it.

Privacy and accountability are not opposites. You can believe that people deserve private conversations *and* believe that people should not use that privacy to harm others. I hold both of those beliefs.

Every Chatalot instance is independently operated. The person who runs your server is responsible for their community and for complying with the laws of their jurisdiction. I provide the software — I do not operate your instance, I do not moderate your content, and I am not liable for how you use it. That responsibility belongs to you and your server's administrator.

If you're looking for a platform designed to evade the law, look elsewhere. That's not what this is.

## Sustainability & Community-Driven Development

Building software takes time, and time costs money. I want to be honest about that.

Chatalot is free and open-source. It will always be free and open-source. But keeping a project alive for years — maintaining infrastructure, reviewing PRs, fixing bugs, shipping features — requires sustainability. So here's my plan:

**The community decides what gets built.** I'm working on a system where users across all Chatalot instances can vote on feature requests. Your voice shapes the roadmap, not just mine. The details are still forming, but the principle is set: the people who use Chatalot should have a real say in where it goes.

**Optional support tiers** may come eventually — things like priority feature requests, cosmetic perks, or a way to put money behind the features you care about most. But the core commitment stands: every feature ships to everyone. No one gets locked out because they can't pay.

**A community website is coming.** A central place to vote on features, report bugs, read announcements, and connect with other instance operators. Think of it as a town hall for the project, not a corporate portal.

I'd rather build this slowly and sustainably than chase growth at the expense of the values that made it worth building in the first place.

## The World Needs Alternatives

The market is dominated by platforms that treat privacy as a premium feature, not a fundamental right. They gate basic functionality behind subscriptions. They harvest your data to train AI models. They comply with mass surveillance programs. They sell to the highest bidder and leave users scrambling.

We deserve better.

Chatalot is open-source, self-hosted, and free. You run it on your own hardware. You control your own data. You set your own rules. No company can pull the rug out from under you because there is no company — just software that respects its users.

## Join the Mission

If any of this resonates with you, I urge you to try Chatalot. Set up a server. Invite your friends. Take your privacy back.

- **Testers are welcome.** The project is actively developed and growing. Your feedback directly shapes what gets built next.
- **Contributors are welcome.** Whether it's code, documentation, bug reports, or ideas — every contribution matters.
- **Skeptics are welcome.** Read the source code. Audit the encryption. Verify the claims. That's what open source is for.

I want more people to grow and take their privacy back. This isn't about competing with the big players for market share — it's about proving that a better model exists. One where you don't have to choose between convenience and privacy. One where your data belongs to you, period.

**You do you. That's what Chatalot is here for.**
