# Moderation Guide

This section covers community-level moderation tools in Chatalot. Moderation keeps your community safe and welcoming -- from issuing a gentle warning to removing disruptive users entirely.

Chatalot's moderation philosophy is **fair, transparent, and escalating**. Start with a warning, escalate to a timeout, and reserve kicks and bans for persistent or severe violations. Every moderation action is logged, giving your team a clear record of what happened and why.

> **Note:** This guide covers **community-level** moderation (warnings, timeouts, kicks, bans). For **instance-level** administration (suspending accounts, purging content, managing files), see the [Admin Guide](../admin-guide/README.md).

## Moderation Principles

1. **Warn first.** Most situations can be resolved with a clear warning and a reason.
2. **Escalate proportionally.** Use timeouts for repeated minor issues. Reserve bans for serious or persistent violations.
3. **Always provide a reason.** Every moderation action supports a reason field. Use it. Transparency builds trust.
4. **Review the evidence.** Check message history and warning records before taking action.
5. **Document decisions.** All moderation actions are logged in the audit trail for accountability.
