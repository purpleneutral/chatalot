> **Status: Complete**

This page explains the layout of the Chatalot chat interface and how to find your way around.

## Desktop Layout Overview

The interface is divided into several areas:

### Header Bar

The top bar stretches across the entire width of the screen and contains (from left to right):

- **Community picker** -- Shows the current community name and icon. Click it to switch communities, join a new one, or access community settings.
- **Channel name** -- Displays the name of the active channel (prefixed with `#`). Click the dropdown arrow to open the navigation sidebar.
- **Search bar** -- A global search field (also accessible with `Ctrl+K`) that lets you search messages and quickly switch channels.
- **Toolbar icons** -- Bookmarks, recent history, scheduled messages, polls, notifications, and members panel toggle.
- **User avatar** -- Click to open the user menu (status picker, voice controls, changelog, feedback, and sign out).

### Community Picker

Click the community name in the top-left to open the community picker. From here you can:

- Switch between communities you have joined
- **Join a Community** using an invite link
- Access **Community Settings** for the current community

### Navigation Sidebar

Click the channel name dropdown (next to the `#` icon) to open the navigation sidebar. It has two tabs:

- **Community** -- Shows all groups in the current community. Each group expands to reveal its text and voice channels. Ungrouped channels (if any) appear at the bottom. You can also discover new groups or join via invite code.
- **DMs** -- Your direct message conversations.

The sidebar includes a **Filter** search box at the top for quickly finding channels by name.

> **Tip:** The sidebar can be collapsed by clicking the channel name again to give you more room for the chat area.

### Main Chat Area

The center of the screen is the message area. It displays messages in chronological order with:

- User avatars and display names
- Timestamps
- Message content (with Markdown rendering, code highlighting, and media embeds)
- Reaction chips below messages
- Typing indicators at the bottom
- An unread message separator when you return to a channel with new messages

### Members Panel

Click the members icon (people silhouette) in the header toolbar to toggle the members panel on the right side. It shows:

- A count of online and total members
- A filter box to search members by name
- Members grouped by online status
- Admin/moderator badges (star icon)

Click on a member's name to view their profile card with display name, bio, pronouns, and status.

### Message Composer

At the bottom of the chat area is the message input. It includes:

- **Attachment button** (paperclip icon) -- Upload files
- **GIF button** -- Search and send GIFs
- **Poll button** -- Create a poll
- **Text input** -- Type your message here
- **Formatting toolbar** -- Bold, italic, strikethrough, code, and link buttons below the input
- **Send button** -- Send the message
- **Schedule button** (clock icon) -- Schedule a message for later
- Keyboard shortcut hints at the bottom (Enter to send, Shift+Enter for new line)

## Mobile Layout

On smaller screens, Chatalot adapts to a single-column layout.

| Mobile Login | Mobile Chat |
|---|---|
| ![Mobile login](../../screenshots/10-mobile-login.png) | ![Mobile chat](../../screenshots/11-mobile-chat.png) |

Key differences on mobile:

- The **sidebar** is hidden by default and opens as an overlay (hamburger menu in the top-left).
- The **members panel** is hidden by default; tap the members icon to open it.
- The **header** is simplified, showing the community icon, channel name, and essential toolbar icons.
- The **message composer** is condensed with a smaller input area and a send arrow button.
- **Message actions** (react, reply, bookmark, edit, delete) appear as an overlay toolbar when you long-press or tap a message.
- The **formatting toolbar** and keyboard shortcut hints are hidden to save space.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Chatalot supports extensive keyboard shortcuts. Here are the most useful ones for navigation:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl+K` | Open the quick switcher to jump to any channel or DM |
| `Up Arrow` | Edit your last message (when the input is empty) |
| `Escape` | Close open panels, modals, or pickers |

> **Tip:** Press `Ctrl+/` or look for the keyboard icon in the UI to see the full list of available shortcuts.
