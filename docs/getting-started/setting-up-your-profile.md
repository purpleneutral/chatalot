Personalize how you appear to other users by configuring your profile and status.

![Settings page](../../screenshots/05-settings.png)

## Opening Settings

There are two ways to reach the settings page:

1. **Gear icon** -- Click the gear/settings icon in the top-right corner of the header bar.
2. **Direct URL** -- Navigate to `/settings` in your browser.

The settings page has a sidebar with several tabs: **Profile**, **Appearance**, **Notifications**, **Chat**, **Voice**, **Security**, and **Account**. Your profile information is on the **Profile** tab, which is selected by default.

## Profile Fields

### Display Name

Your display name is what other users see in chat messages, the members panel, and DMs. It can be different from your username and can be up to 64 characters long. If you leave it blank, your username is shown instead.

### Custom Status

A short text status that appears alongside your name. Use it to let others know what you are up to, for example "In a meeting" or "On vacation."

### Bio

A freeform text area where you can write a short description about yourself. This appears on your profile card when other users click your name.

### Pronouns

An optional field for your pronouns (e.g., "he/him", "she/her", "they/them"). Displayed on your profile card.

## Avatar

Your avatar is the profile picture shown next to your messages and in the members panel. To set or change it:

1. On the **Profile** tab in Settings, click the avatar upload area or the **Upload** button.
2. Select an image file from your device.
3. The avatar updates immediately after upload.

To remove your avatar, click the **Remove** option. A letter-based placeholder (the first letter of your display name) will be shown instead.

## Profile Banner

You can also upload a banner image that appears at the top of your profile card. The upload and removal process works the same way as the avatar.

## Setting Your Status

Your online status is a colored indicator that shows your availability to other users. You can change it from the **user menu** in the main chat interface (click your avatar in the top-right corner of the header).

The available statuses are:

| Status | Indicator | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **Online** | Green | You are available and active |
| **Away** | Yellow | You are temporarily away |
| **Do Not Disturb** | Red | You do not want to be disturbed |
| **Invisible** | Gray | You appear offline to others but can still use Chatalot normally |

> **Tip:** Your status persists across sessions. If you set yourself to "Do Not Disturb," it stays that way until you change it.

## Next Step

With your profile set up, continue to [Navigating the Interface](./navigating-the-interface.md) to learn your way around.
