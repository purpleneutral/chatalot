# Admin Guide

This section covers instance-level administration for Chatalot. Admin features are for managing the server as a whole -- user accounts, registration, file storage, security, and compliance. This is distinct from community-level moderation, which is covered in the [Moderation Guide](../moderation-guide/README.md).

> **Note:** Admin features are only accessible to users with the **Instance Admin** or **Instance Owner** role. The first user to register on a new instance is automatically assigned both roles.
