# Customization

Chatalot gives you full control over how the app looks and feels. All customization settings live in **Settings > Appearance** and **Settings > Chat**.

## Sections

| Page | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Themes](./themes.md) | Dark mode, light mode, and system-follow |
| [Color Palettes](./color-palettes.md) | 8 built-in palettes plus a fully custom option |
| [Accent Colors](./accent-colors.md) | 8 accent colors that tint buttons, links, and highlights |
| [Density and Fonts](./density-and-fonts.md) | Message density, bubble style, time format, and font size |

## Where to Find These Settings

Open **Settings** (gear icon) from the sidebar and navigate to:

- **Appearance** -- themes, palettes, accent colors, density, fonts, and accessibility
- **Chat** -- input behavior, formatting toolbar, link previews, and read receipts

All preferences are saved locally and synced to the server, so they follow you across devices.
