# Chat Settings

> **Status: Complete**

The Chat tab in Settings controls how you compose and view messages. These options affect input behavior and display features.

## Input Settings

### Send Behavior

Choose how messages are sent from the text input:

| Option | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **Enter** (default) | Pressing Enter sends the message. Use Shift+Enter for a new line. |
| **Ctrl+Enter** | Pressing Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter on Mac) sends the message. Enter inserts a new line. |

Ctrl+Enter mode is useful if you frequently write multi-line messages and want Enter to simply add line breaks.

### Formatting Toolbar

A formatting toolbar can be shown below the message input, providing quick-access buttons for:

- **Bold** (Ctrl+B)
- **Italic** (Ctrl+I)
- **Strikethrough**
- **Code**
- **Links**

The toolbar is enabled by default. Toggle it off if you prefer a cleaner input area and are comfortable using Markdown shortcuts directly.

## Display Settings

### Link Previews

When enabled (default), URLs posted in messages will show a rich preview card with the page title, description, and thumbnail image when available.

Toggle this off if you prefer a cleaner message view or are on a limited connection.

### Read Receipts

When enabled (default), other users can see when you have read their messages. Disabling this prevents your read status from being sent to others.

> **Tip:** Disabling read receipts is a personal preference. Other users who have read receipts enabled will still show their read status to you.

## How to Access

1. Open **Settings** (gear icon in the sidebar).
2. Click the **Chat** tab.
3. Adjust settings in the **Input** and **Display** sections.

All changes take effect immediately and are synced across your devices.
