# Reactions

> **Status: Complete**

Reactions let you respond to messages with emoji without sending a separate message. They appear as small emoji badges below the message.

## Adding a Reaction

### Quick Reactions

1. Hover over a message to reveal the action bar.
2. Click the smiley face icon to open the quick reaction picker.
3. Choose from the six quick-reaction emojis: thumbs up, heart, laughing, party, surprised, and sad.

### Full Emoji Picker

For access to the complete emoji set:

1. Hover over a message and click the smiley face icon.
2. Click the **+** button (or the "more" option) to open the full emoji picker.
3. Search or browse for any emoji.
4. Click an emoji to add it as a reaction.

The full emoji picker supports:

- Searching by emoji name
- Browsing emoji categories
- Custom community emojis (if the community has any configured)

### From the Context Menu

1. Right-click on a message.
2. Select **React** to open the reaction picker.

## Toggling Reactions

- Click an **existing reaction badge** on a message to add your reaction to it (increasing the count).
- Click a reaction badge you have already reacted with to **remove** your reaction.

Your own reactions are visually highlighted so you can see which emojis you have reacted with.

## Multiple Reactions

- A single message can have up to **20 unique emoji reactions**.
- Multiple users can react with the same emoji -- the badge shows the count of users.
- You can react with multiple different emojis on the same message.

## Reaction Cooldown

To prevent spam, there is a **200 millisecond** cooldown between reaction actions. If you try to add or remove reactions too quickly, you will receive a "rate limited" error.

## Reactions in Threads

Reactions work the same way in [thread panels](./threads.md). You can add quick reactions or use the full emoji picker on thread messages.

## Custom Emoji

If your Community has custom emojis configured, they appear in the emoji picker and can be used as reactions. Custom emojis are Community-specific and display as small images rather than Unicode characters.
