## How Chatalot is Organized

Chatalot uses a three-level hierarchy:

```
Community
  └── Group
        └── Channel (text or voice)
```

- **Communities** are the top-level unit -- the main organizational container. Each community has its own members, roles, settings, and custom emoji.
- **Groups** are organizational folders within a community that contain channels and can be collapsed in the sidebar.
- **Channels** are where conversations happen. Text channels support rich messaging; voice channels support real-time audio and video.

You also have access to **Direct Messages (DMs)**, which exist outside of any community hierarchy.
