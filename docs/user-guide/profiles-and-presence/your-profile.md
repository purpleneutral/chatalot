## Where to Edit

All profile settings are available at **Settings > Profile**. To get there:

1. Click the **gear icon** or navigate to `/settings`.
2. Select the **Profile** tab in the sidebar.

## Display Name

Your display name is what other users see next to your messages, in the members panel, and in voice calls. It is separate from your login username (which starts with `@`).

- Maximum length: **64 characters**
- A character counter is shown below the input field.
- If you clear your display name, other users will see a truncated version of your user ID.

To change it:

1. Edit the **Display Name** field.
2. Click **Save Profile**.

## Avatar

Your avatar is the profile picture that appears next to your messages, in voice call tiles, and on your profile card.

### Uploading an Avatar

2. Click the camera icon that appears.
3. Select an image file from your computer.
4. An image cropper opens, letting you adjust the crop area and zoom. Click **Confirm** to upload.
5. The avatar uploads and updates immediately.

### Removing Your Avatar

If you have a custom avatar and want to revert to the default:

1. Click **Remove avatar** below your current avatar.
2. Your avatar will revert to showing your initial (the first letter of your display name) on a colored background.

## Profile Banner

The banner is a wide image displayed at the top of your profile card.

### Uploading a Banner

1. In the **Profile Banner** section, hover over the banner area.
2. Click the camera icon.
3. Select an image file.
4. An image cropper opens with a 3:1 aspect ratio. Adjust the crop area and zoom, then click **Confirm** to upload.

## Bio

A short description about yourself that appears on your profile card.

- There is no strict character limit displayed, but keep it concise.
- Supports plain text only (no Markdown formatting).

## Pronouns

Optional pronouns (e.g., "he/him", "she/her", "they/them") that are displayed on your profile card. This field is free-form text.

## Custom Status

A short status message visible to other users. This appears below your display name in certain views.

- Maximum length: **128 characters**
- Example uses: "In a meeting", "On vacation", "Streaming"
- Custom status is separate from your presence status (Online, Away, etc.).

To set a custom status:

1. Edit the **Custom Status** field under Personal Info.
2. Click **Save Profile**.

To clear it, delete the text and save.

## Saving Changes

After editing any profile field, click the **Save Profile** button at the bottom of the Personal Info section. A confirmation message ("Profile updated.") appears on success.

> **Tip:** Your avatar and banner upload immediately when you select a file -- no need to click Save for those.
