- **Banner** -- A header image shown on your profile card.
- **Bio** -- A short description about yourself.
- **Pronouns** -- Optional pronouns displayed on your profile card.
- **Custom status** -- A short text status visible to others (e.g., "In a meeting").

All profile fields except your username and presence status are editable through **Settings > Profile**.
