# Viewing Profiles

> **Status: Complete**

How to view other users' profile cards and browse the members panel in Chatalot.

## Profile Cards

Clicking on a user's name (in a message, the members panel, or elsewhere) opens their **profile card** -- a popup overlay showing their public profile information.

### Information Shown

A profile card displays the following:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Banner** | A wide header image (or a gradient if none is set) |
| **Avatar** | The user's profile picture, or their initial on a colored background |
| **Display name** | Their chosen display name |
| **Username** | Their `@username` (unique login identifier) |
| **Pronouns** | Optional pronouns (e.g., "they/them") |
| **Custom status** | A short status message if set (e.g., "On vacation") |
| **Bio** | A short description about the user |
| **Presence status** | Their current online status (Online, Idle, DND, or Offline) |
| **Roles** | Their role in the current channel/community (Owner, Admin, Moderator, Member) |

### Opening a Profile Card

- **From a message:** Click the sender's display name or avatar above their message.
- **From the members panel:** Click any member's name in the right-hand panel.
- **From DM list:** Click a contact's name in the Direct Messages section of the sidebar.

The profile card appears as a floating popup anchored near where you clicked. Click anywhere outside the card to close it.

### Actions on a Profile Card

Depending on your relationship with the user and your permissions, the profile card may include action buttons such as:

- **Send DM** -- Open a direct message conversation with the user.
- **Block** -- Block the user (prevents DMs and hides their messages).
- **Report** -- Report the user to server administrators.
- **Kick from voice** -- Remove the user from a voice call (requires moderator permissions).

## Members Panel

The members panel shows all members of the currently selected channel or community. It appears as a sidebar on the right side of the chat view.

### Opening the Members Panel

Click the **people icon** in the channel header toolbar (available for non-DM channels). The icon is highlighted when the panel is open.

### What the Members Panel Shows

Members are listed with:

- **Avatar** -- Their profile picture or initial
- **Display name** -- Their chosen name
- **Presence indicator** -- A colored dot showing their online status
- **Role badge** -- If they have a special role (Owner, Admin, Moderator)

Members are typically sorted with online members shown first, followed by offline members.

### Interacting with Members

- **Click a member** to open their profile card.
- **Right-click a member** in a voice call to access volume controls.

## Presence Indicators

Throughout the interface, small colored dots indicate each user's presence status:

| Color | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Green | Online |
| Yellow | Idle / Away |
| Red | Do Not Disturb |
| Gray | Offline or Invisible |

These indicators appear on avatars, in the members panel, and in the DM contact list.

> **Note:** Users with Invisible status appear as Offline to everyone else. There is no way to distinguish between Invisible and genuinely Offline users.
